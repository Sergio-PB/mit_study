Files made while studying AI from MIT's course

# About
This repository refers to the files I made when studying a MIT artificial intelligence course.

# How to use
You must go to https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/ and download the course files.
I uploaded my answers to the problems, and I'm not sure if you can run them by itself.
Feel free to look them and study through them.

# Aditional notes
I intend to update this furthermore, with a decent version so anyone can run without needing to download extra stuff.
